<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>
