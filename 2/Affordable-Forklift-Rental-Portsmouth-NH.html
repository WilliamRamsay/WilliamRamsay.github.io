<p>Raymond forklifts offer a wide variety of operating positions that are engineered to enhance driver comfort and reduce fatigue for this specific application. We'll bring the forklift lift truck to you, and pick it up when you're done.

Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
