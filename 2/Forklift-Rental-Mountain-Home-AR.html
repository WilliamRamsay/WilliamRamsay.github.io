<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

Class V forklifts are rider fork trucks, with cabs and seated controls, internal combustion engines, and pneumatic tires. We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks. If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Charges will continue until the equipment is returned to the rental supplier and the equipment is available to be rented to the next customer. You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches. We are the Forklift Professionals. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright.</p>

<p>Stringent emission norms are driving the demand for electric forklifts. Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear. The Raymond High-capacity Reach-Fork truck integrates telematics capabilities to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist.
