<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder.
