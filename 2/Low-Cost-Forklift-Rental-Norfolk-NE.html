<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze. Our forklift trucks are dependable and reliable to get to the job done in a safe and efficient manner. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
