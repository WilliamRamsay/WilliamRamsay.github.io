<h2>Get Heavy Duty Hand Pallet Truck At Best Price! Albion </h2>
<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>If you wish to eventually own your own forklift, we recommend that you consider the rent-to-own package that we have to offer.

<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Albion</h2>
<p>They have a more powerful engine than other types of forklifts , making them reach higher and faster speeds. These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel. When working in or walking through areas where powered industrial trucks are being used, especially forklifts, be mindful of traffic patterns and do not cross immediately in front of a moving forklift.</p>
<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>
<p>Our order pickers are available in brands you can trust such as Unicarriers, EP Equipment and Xilin and are backed by 100% after sales service and support. The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
<p>I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts. This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>
