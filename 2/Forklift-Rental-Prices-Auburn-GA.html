<p>When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Conversion training - This is for those who have experience with some type of forklift truck but wish to advance into other types.

Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity.
