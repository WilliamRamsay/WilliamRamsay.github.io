Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape.

<h2>Industrial Forklift Trucks Giddings </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>

<p>Not sure if this will be a problem, but I am going to Vegas this Sunday 3-26-06 and am driving from New Mexico I have a truck (Nissan Titan) that is lifted about 6 inches and has 35inch tires.
