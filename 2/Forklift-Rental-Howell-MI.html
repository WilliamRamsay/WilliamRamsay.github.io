<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions. It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations. Lifted trucks are never seen in New England, the New York area, the Miami area, or Hollywood.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly.

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
