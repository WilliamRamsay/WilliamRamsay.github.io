<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
