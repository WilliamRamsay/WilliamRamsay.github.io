Our professional, capable staff can help you choose the best truck for your needs, and we provide comprehensive support for our lines as well as almost every other make of lift truck on the market. Fork lifts are often used to unload materials from trucks, ships, and other large containers used in shipping and distribution.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
