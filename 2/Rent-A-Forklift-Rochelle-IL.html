<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials.

<h2>Truck With Lift Rochelle</h2>

<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications.
