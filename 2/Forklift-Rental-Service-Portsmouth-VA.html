<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Portsmouth </h2>
<p>By raising the truck's chassis, more room is provided for large size tires and wheels. Long Term Forklift Rental enables you to work with a minimal amount of equipment reducing the need for spare or surplus equipment. Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies. For a more controlled ride that keeps your tires touching the ground beneath you for continuous contact, you need Jeep shocks to replace your old, worn out ones and put you back in control in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Maintain forklifts in safe condition free of defective or missing parts through daily visual checks and regular preventive maintenance. Whether you're looking for an energy efficient electric forklift , an LP-gas forklift , a high-capacity diesel lift truck , or specialty equipment to handle the most strenuous heavy lifting projects, our rental fleet of high performance Hyster and Yale forklifts is at your service.</p>
