<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>With the walking operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise. Rule: Trucks will not be loaded in excess of their rated capacity.
