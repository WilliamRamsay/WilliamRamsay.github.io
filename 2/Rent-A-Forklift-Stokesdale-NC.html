<h3>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Stokesdale NC 27357</h3>
<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs. Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>
<p>The operator hand transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time. Powered pallet trucks operate to a very similar principle as hand-pallet trucks. We have grown from a primarily used forklift warehouse to a fully functioning forklift dealership. This is the leading cause of death involving lift trucks. When a traditional forklift isn't necessary but lifting product above a second-tier rack is, the Toyota Industrial Stacker is a cost-efficient, easy-to-use solution.</p>
