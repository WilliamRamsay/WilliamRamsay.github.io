Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
