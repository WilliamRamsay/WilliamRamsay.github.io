<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>This enables a controlled lifting and elevating of the pallet. In the future, the Chinese Forklift Market will still have huge growth potentials and forklift sales in 2023 will double that in 2018. These are some of the reasons why this pallet jack truck could be the one you are looking for. ForkliftTrader is always looking for new inventory. If you are allowed to test drive some lifted trucks alone, you may need to bring in documents like copies of your driver's license.</p>
