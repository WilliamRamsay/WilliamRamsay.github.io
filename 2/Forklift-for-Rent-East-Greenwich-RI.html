Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion.

Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
