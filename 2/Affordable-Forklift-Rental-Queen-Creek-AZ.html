<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>

<h3>Heavy Equipment Forklift Queen Creek AZ</h3>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height. Once you've found the right type of rough terrain forklift for your job site, the biggest decision you'll have to make is between renting and buying.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Designed for terrain that pneumatic tire forklifts can't handle. Best for: Toyota's electric order picker is ideal for many types of operations and industries including: warehouse order picking, and Third Party Logistics (3PL) companies with square footage over 10,000 square feet.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
