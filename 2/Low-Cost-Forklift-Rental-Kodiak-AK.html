<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>
<h2>Brands and Types of Side Loader Forklifts in Kodiak </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144‚Äù you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>A wide range of options allows you to adapt our order pickers to your own individual logistics profile. Sit-down forklifts come in 3-wheel and 4-wheel models. We'll make an offer on lift trucks in any condition. We are specialists in quality forklift equipment, forklift sales, forklift rentals, and on-site repairs of forklifts.
