When you book with us, you are booking with an experienced company with trainers that have had years of experience working in warehouses picking stock at all different heights on the order picker, trainers that have been safety representatives and store-men.

<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts.

<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
