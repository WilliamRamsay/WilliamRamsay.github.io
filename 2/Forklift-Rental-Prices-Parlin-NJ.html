<h3>Hydraulic Forklift Parlin NJ</h3>
<p>Whether you're looking for lifted truck shocks or, specifically, shocks for a 6-inch lift, you can rest assured we'll have what you need. These forklift trucks are manoeuvrable and swift to cover ground. The company's SLP Series features three low-profile models rated at 5,000, 6,000, and 8,000 pounds lift capacity, all using a 74-horsepower Kohler engine and shuttle-type transmission with torque converter.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
