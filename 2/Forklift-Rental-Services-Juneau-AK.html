A telehandler forklift is also known as a telescopic forklift or a reach forklift. IC forklifts are a different class of forklift from the previous ones, as these models are often better suited for outdoor use. FMI provides an exclusive analysis of Global Pallet Trucks Market”. If you plan on going for the former, make sure you are aware of how much you have to spend on suspension lift kits.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it.

Our customers come to us because of our commitment to service excellence and our varied product offering which includes new forklifts for sale, used, rentals and more.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Linde reach trucks are equipped with such features as adjustable steering. These are just the most common types of forklift trucks.

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.
