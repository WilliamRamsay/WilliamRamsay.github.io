<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road.

This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination. Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures.</p>

Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician.
