In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Forklifts and lift trucks are an essential part of most construction projects and carry their own set of hazards depending on the vehicle type and the workplace where the truck is used.

<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over.
