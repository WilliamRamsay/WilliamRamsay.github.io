Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work.
