<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.

<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles.
