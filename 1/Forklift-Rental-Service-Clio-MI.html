<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires â€” powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>

This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Lifting Equipment Clio</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
