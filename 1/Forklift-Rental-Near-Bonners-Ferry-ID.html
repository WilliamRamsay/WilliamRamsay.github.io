<h2>Forklift Rental Service Bonners Ferry </h2>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels ) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer. And with how much you can save with a high-quality pre-owned vehicle and still get behind the wheel of a safe, reliable, and ready for adventure car, truck or SUV.</p>
<p>In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts.
