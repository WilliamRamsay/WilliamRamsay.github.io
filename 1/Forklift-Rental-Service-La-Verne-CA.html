Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop. 7. 7 Powered Industrial Truck - Definition A mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier materials.</p>

<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking.
