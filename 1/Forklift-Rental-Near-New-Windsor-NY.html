One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks.

The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height.
