Ask potential suppliers what their fleet size is relative to the types of equipment that you will be renting.

<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably. Forklift truck sales in North America saw their third consecutive year of growth in 2017, the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) reports. With the largest short-term forklift, lift truck and material handling equipment rental fleet in our New York State area, we are confident to meet any job requirement.</p>
