While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts.

<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area.

Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
