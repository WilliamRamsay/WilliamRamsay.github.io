The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>

Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
