<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>

Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels ) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer.
