We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>
