<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution.

The low lift electric hand pallet jacks, also known as walkies” are a common type of class three forklift. We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Standards Notice: SN 66 allows the use of a spring-loaded brake system or dock lock in lieu of chocking, as a means that secures trucks or trailers to loading docks. Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available.</p>

No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk.
