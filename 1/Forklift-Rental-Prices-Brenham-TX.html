Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Engine power is often a critical component of buying a rough terrain forklift. The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles. The TAWI Mobile Order Picker is a one-of-a-kind solution for mobile material handling and order picking from pallet racks. A lifted truck is a truck that has had its suspension altered to increase the height of the vehicle, and sometimes fitted with large wheels.</p>

If any of the foregoing trucks is equipped with attachments, the rated capacity shall be expressed in pounds at a specified load center and for a specified load elevation.</p>
