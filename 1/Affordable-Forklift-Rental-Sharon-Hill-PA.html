<h3>How Forklifts Work Sharon Hill PA 19079</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Now that you know the lift truck type and model that will best suit your application, the Sun Equipment professionals will figure out all the details for you. Herc Rentals is part of the Hertz Group, and operates independently of the car rental side of the business.
